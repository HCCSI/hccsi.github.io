lead: "Customer service delivery as measured by the Hillsborough County Consolidated Service Index (HCCSI) held steady in the center of the desired 100.0 to 110.0 point range during September. For the month, the HCCSI changed little, closing at 105.48, versus 105.95 in August. A reading of 105.48 suggests that, on a combined basis, the County’s 37 customer service indicators are performing +5.48% better than expected. Moreover, the fact that the HCCSI held at +105.00 in consecutive months suggests consistent, quality service delivery by
the combined staff heading into the final business quarter of 2019."
