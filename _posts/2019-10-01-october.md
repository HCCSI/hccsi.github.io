lead: "The Hillsborough County Consolidated Service Index (HCCSI) hit 106.52 in October, its highest point of the year. This implies that, on a combined basis, the county’s 37 customer service indicators are performing +6.52% better than expected. The index crossed the 106.00 level thanks in no small part to the outstanding customer service provided by the Pet Resource Center during October. It was the PRC’s best month of the year and the best performing month since the department began quantifying customer service delivery in 2018, with the various PRC sections posting strong results across the board."

These are just those customer service indicators that fared the least versus their monthly targets for the month; they may still be scoring relatively high.
