lead: "Customer service delivery as measured by the Hillsborough County Consolidated Service Index (HCCSI) improved +0.53% during December. For the month, the HCCSI finished at 103.29 points versus 102.75 in the prior month. The 103.29 score implies that, on a combined basis, the county’s 35 customer service indicators are performing +3.29% better than goal. For all of 2019, the HCCSI averaged 103.67, indicating that customer service delivery was +3.67% above plan for the year. As a point of reference, the preliminary 2019 Hillsborough County Market Index – a weighted basket of local and state economic and business indicators – was 102.69. That illustrates that prevailing market conditions finished a very robust 2019 nearly one full point below the rate of customer service delivery by the three County Departments that comprise the HCCSI. This suggests a strong return on investment for Hillsborough County residents and businesses over the year."
