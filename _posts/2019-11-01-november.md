lead: "Customer service delivery as measured by the Hillsborough County Consolidated Service Index (HCCSI) remained well above goal during November, despite a slight month-to-month correction. November’s HCCSI finished at 102.75 points, dipping from a very strong 106.52 in October. The 102.75 score implies that, on a combined basis, the County’s 35 customer service indicators are performing +2.75% better than expected. The more stable three-month moving average (HCCSI- MA3) stands at 104.92, which is in the middle of the desired 100.00 to 110.00 point range. This suggests that, over the short-run, combined customer service by these three departments remains at a high level with one month remaining in the calendar year."

<em class="small">\* Note: This does not necessarily mean that a customer service indicator did not achieve its goal or is performing poorly. These are just those customer service indicators that fared the least versus their monthly targets for the month; they may still be scoring relatively high.
